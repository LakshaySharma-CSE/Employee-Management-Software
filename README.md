# Employee-Management-Software
Employee Management Software – A Python-based project built for my Class 12 board exam. It uses CSV files, Pandas, and Matplotlib to manage employee records—add, update, delete, and visualize data easily. It’s scalable and a great introduction to data handling and visualization.
